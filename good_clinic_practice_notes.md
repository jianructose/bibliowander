- After the No Objection Letter is received by the sponsor



## 4. Informed Consent

### 4.1 You are reviewing a consent form that will be submitted to the Research Ethics Board (REB) for review. The consent form states that participants will be reimbursed for travel expenses related to study participation upon study completion. Is this statement acceptable?
- This is not acceptable as payment is contingent upon study completion and thus is coercive.

### 4.2 A 46-year-old man is currently enrolled in a Phase 1 study of a drug for severe diabetic neuropathy. While the study is ongoing, a new drug becomes commercially available that may have equal or greater benefit to the study participant. The investigator should do which of the following?
- 	Discuss the pros and cons of both the investigational drug and the commercially available drug and then allow the participant to decide whether to withdraw from the research to take the new drug.

### 4.3 According to ICH GCP, if there is no intended clinical benefit to the research subjects, how should this be addressed in the informed consent discussion and the written informed consent form and any other written information to be provided to the subjects?
- The research subject should be made aware that there is not intended benefit.

### 5.3 A participant has just completed his study visit and slips on a puddle of water on the floor when leaving the clinic. The Principal Investigator sees him and notes he has a sprained wrist as a result of the fall. He is given instructions to wrap it and ice for 24-48 hours. What is the appropriate action?
